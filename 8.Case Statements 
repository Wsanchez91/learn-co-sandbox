A case statment is a power tool to test a certian condition.
  there are 3 basic steps to a case statement:
  1. we will need a value.
  2. we will want one or more conditions to campare to the value.
  3. we will add the code we want to run if that condition is met.
  
example:  
  
case name 
 
  when "Alice"
    puts "Hello, Alice!"
  when "The White Rabbit"
    puts "Don't be late, White Rabbit"
  when "The Mad Hatter"
    puts "Welcome to the tea party, Mad Hatter"
  when "The Queen of Hearts"
    puts "Please don't chop off my head!"
  else 
    puts "Whoooo are you?"
end

Steps to create case statement:

1. Create a value
  A case statement starts with the case keyword followed by a value to test.
  
  case greeting
  # ...
  end

2. Create the Condition:
  Next, the [when] keyword is followed by a condition.
  
  case greeting
  when "unfriendly_greeting"
    #...
  when "friendly_greeting"
    #...
end

3. Add the code:
  The functionality that we wish to happen when the condition is met is placed on an indented line directly under the when line. Let's define the behavior
  
  greeting = "friendly_greeting"
 
case greeting
  when "unfriendly_greeting"
    puts "What do you want!?"
  when "friendly_greeting"
    puts "Hi! How are you?"
end
