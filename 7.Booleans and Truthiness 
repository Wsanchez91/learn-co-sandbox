# Booleans are [true] or [false] methods
In Ruby only false and nil are falsey. Everything else is truthy (yes, even 0 is truthy).

A single bang operator [!]: If you forget to memorize this handy chart, there is a trick you can use to determine if a value is truthy or falsey.

The double bang operator: A "double-bang operator" (!!) will return true or false based on whether a value is truthy or falsey to begin with.

when writing a method, you can actully write out [true] or [false] to determine what is [true] or [false].

# Boolean Opereation:
re really methods which means that they have return values. What do they return? true or false of course!

In Ruby there are three main boolean operators:

! ("single-bang") which represents "NOT",
&& ("double-ampersand") which represents "AND", and
|| ("double-pipe") which represents "OR".
