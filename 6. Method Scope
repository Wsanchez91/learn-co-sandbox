# Method Scope and Variable Scope
Scope is a area/section/location were a certain [def] information/data stays in. 
for example:

name = "Joe" # Variable and its not within the [def] method below.
 
def greeting(name)
   puts "Hello, #{name}"
end

greeting("Sophie") # if i run this, i will get "Hello, Sophie", since we are just using the [def] method for the statment.

# Method Scope in Ruby is anything between [def] and [end].

evil_monster = "Bowser"
 
def princess_peaches_castle
  puts "#{evil_monster} is trying to kidnap Princess Peach!"
end

if i run this, i will get an error saying NameError: Undefined Local Variable, because evil_monster = "Bowser" is outside of the [def], and its not calling on the [def] method to change the name.

if we change the [def] methed that starts with:

def princess_peaches_castle(evil_monster)

Then i will work because the variable is stated i the method.
